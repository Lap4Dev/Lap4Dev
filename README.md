- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lap4Dev
- 👀 I’m interested in creating Single Page Application and a many bots for different sites. In general I'm going to be Full Stack Developer in the future.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++. Also I'm going to learn Angular platform to create SPA. And of course TypeSript for working with angular.
- 📜 How did I start my career in IT? I have been intrested in information technology since childhood. When I was in the eighth grade I started to learn C++ 
with my school computer science teacher. Soon I participated in the C ++ competition and took second place. I remember that I only needed one point to be the first :( 
A little later I participated in the IT competition and took third place, but I didn't prepare for it at all) Later I participated in these competitions several times 
and was always among the three winners! Subsequently I started learning JS, HTML and CSS and it gave me some income. I have been developed bots for various special sites for 3-4 years!
I have had a huge number of successful sales of my product and I have received many orders from my clients and successfully fulfilled them. In general I had more than
100 customers.
- My projects:
-     I created the MTcaptcha auto solver
-     Many different bots for sites
-     Created a telegram bot to control a program written in C#
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on SoftServe or Sigma!
